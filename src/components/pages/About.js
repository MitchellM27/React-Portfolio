      <p>
      My name is Mitchell Mudgett. I am from San Diego, CA and I am working on becoming a
            full stack web developer. I am 26 years old and looking to change my career path. This portfolio will contain work that I have completed in my 
            education process at the UCSD extension bootcamp, as well as projects that I have taken
            on my own.
